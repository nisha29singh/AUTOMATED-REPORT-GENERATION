# Description  
This project demonstrates an automated workflow for loading, analyzing, and reporting weather data using Python. The system reads weather data from a CSV file, performs basic statistical analysis on temperature and humidity, identifies key weather patterns, and then generates a structured PDF report using the FPDF library. This approach is ideal for automating daily or periodic reporting tasks without manual intervention.
1. Data Loading
*Reads weather data from a CSV file using pandas.
*Provides basic error handling to ensure robustness.
2. Data Analysis
*Average temperature and humidity
*Highest and lowest temperatures
*Most frequent weather condition
3. PDF Report Generation
-Uses the FPDF library to:
*Create a new PDF document
*Add analysis results as formatted text
*Save the file to disk
